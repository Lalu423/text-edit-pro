## Description
    This is my attempt at a PWA. The purpose of this PWA is to edit the text of your web page.\
    It can be downloaded and used offline, which is the plus to using a PWA. 

## Installation
    This app does not need to be installed, however you should install it. 
    This will allow the app to function offline. 

## Usage
    The purpose of this app is to be a PWA text editor that you can use in your dev tools.
